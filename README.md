# [**South Stand Brewery & Taproom**](https://joelmichaelrutter.github.io/south-stand-MS1/index.html)
## Milestone Project 1
### General Purpose and Introduction
This web application is for a fictitious micro-brewery and taproom based in Warrington. The brewery fills a gap in the market as there are limited options for locals to enjoy an intimate and bespoke drinking experience in the town. In addition, most bars in the area tend to be part of a chain - conforming to the stereotypical ‘pub’ image, with limited beer choices and little online presence – therefore missing out a large demographic of younger people. 

For the South Stand Brewery & Taproom, I wanted to create an enticing, user-friendly site that reflects the following themes - 

1. **Sleek, simple, and professional** – A professional design that will stand out compared to other venues in the sector.  I wanted ease of learning and use and aim to keep it very contained so that it can be used with minimal navigation to other pages.
2. **Robust yet friendly** – The brewery and taproom dynamic would appeal to a ‘hipster’ audience. If you look at other companies that offer the similar dynamics such as Founders Brewing or Brewdog, the typography, copy, images and branding are targeted at their key demographic. Whilst it is important to consider the culture of the audience, one of the business goals of the site is to increase awareness and in course footfall to the venue itself. On that basis, I will be using typography, images, and colour to give the effect of a rugged, no-nonsense bar where beer is the passion, but using calls to action and content to promote a friendly atmosphere.
3. **Enticing** – Normal e-commerce or B2B web applications have a focus on providing a lot of information, or at least having it available to a user if they wish to see it. I will adopt elements of this approach, however, to generate interest and footfall, I wanted to create a site that felt enticing and leave users wanting more through interesting content and tempting background imagery.

# UserExperience
In this section, I will discuss the user experience considerations I implemented during the development process.
## **Strategy**
### **BusinessGoals**
The promotion of the business’ ethos is important to engage with a user on an emotional level through the content not just design, structure, and layout. The other main goal was to prompt the user to see the business as a positive place where they will enjoy spending time digitally and in person.
The main points I considered during the strategy in terms of the business’ goals were:
* Increase awareness of business and brand.
* Increase footfall in the venue.
* Increase sales of the business’ own craft brewed beer.
* Generate an enticing, exciting environment to leave users wanting to explore the site and increase conversions (booking a table).
### **UserStories**
Below are the user stories that needed to be fulfilled for the project to be successful from the perspective of the user:
* To discover the brand and venue through exciting and adaptive design, ensuring scalability through viewport sizes and on different browsers with no degradation of content.
* To navigate through the site with ease.
* To discover the locally brewed craft beer and drinks menu offered by the business.
* To be able to book a table to guarantee themselves a place to sit when they visit.
* To access key business information such as map location, address, opening times and contact information.
## **StructurePlane**
I originally wanted to keep the site contained to a single page to make it simplistic and easy to use. I began the build by creating a homepage with a few sections underneath – creating a plain but workable site. However, when I experimented with the site in GitPod, I considered my user and what they would expect to see on the page – putting my assumptions aside.  

Professional websites are often compartmentalised to prevent an information overload for the user. With this in mind, I split the site into its respective pages. This also enabled me to develop some navigation functions to provide visual feedback, in the form of a bottom border, to easily identify to the user which page they were interacting with. With the user in mind, to complement the user-friendly navigation, I wanted to create a consistent, visual journey throughout the site – choosing a background image, with both in focus and out-of-focus elements, to add to the theme of enticement. 
## **SkeletonPlane**
There were two stages to the skeleton process:
1. I started by drawing some basic concepts of what I wanted the site to look like on desktop and mobile, images of the drawings can be found below:
![PaperWireframes](assets/read-me-images/paper-wireframe.png)
2. After drawing up some basic concepts, I refined the concept further by using [Miro](https://miro.com/login/). Below you will find the links to images of my wireframes:

## **ColourChoices**
The colour palette for this project was developed in line with the themes of the site, to recap those themes are:
1. Sleek, simple, and professional 
2. Robust yet friendly
3. Enticing  

You can explore my colour palette in the image below:
![ColourPalette](assets/read-me-images/south-stand-color-palette.png)
I used the above colour palette to make the design accessible - always using the lighter shades on darker backgrounds as my main font colour. This also added to the professional feel of the page and preventing jarring contrasts. 

Below you will find in-depth considerations about the colour selection and the themes the colours promote - 

* #### **(#3f4042)** - To reflect my first two themes, I chose a sleek, dark grey to serve as the background colour of my navigation bar which is arguably one of the most important elements displayed on the site, as it appears on all pages and has a high degree of importance to the user due to its function. For consistency, I also introduced this colour into other elements such as content cards, containers, and buttons.
* #### **(#d6a419)** – Whilst it is important to have a professional feel to the website, I wanted to deliver the theme of friendliness and introduce a community-feel for the user. I chose a warm orange to contrast and complement the dark grey. I also chose this colour based on its similarity to the colour of pale ale which is one of the main products sold by the business. I used this colour on the pseudo class for my navigation links so that when the user hovers over the link, the colour of the text turns from very light grey to orange providing visual feedback as to what function the user is completing. 
* #### **RGBA (181, 138, 27 0.9)** – To ensure consistency, I used a [HEX to RGBA converter](http://hex2rgba.devoth.com/) to convert my orange hex colour into a RGBA value. I lowered the alpha value ever so slightly and used it as the background colour for my homepage overlay. This allows my enticing home background image to be seen through it without degrading the contrast or readability of the overlay.
* #### **(#51576b)** – I wanted a clear difference between my dark grey navigation bar and the footer of the page, so I chose a complementary turquoise colour. This tone combined with the colour of the font creates a nice balance of contrast, making it easy to read but not so much that the contrast in colours is jarring.  
* #### **(#dbdbdb)** – I introduced the smoky, light grey to add to the alluring theme of the site. As mentioned above in terms of font colour, it makes for an excellent balance of contrast and is pleasing to the eye. I also used this colour as a container background colour to contrast against my main dark grey as an almost semantic indication that the content is changing.
## TypographyChoices
For the project, I used two fonts imported into my CSS file from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). They were selected in line with the overarching themes that I wanted to achieve. The fonts I chose, examples and explanations are detailed below:
### **Raleway** 
![RalewayImage](assets/read-me-images/raleway-picture.png)  
I chose Raleway as its smooth and modern tone reflected the themes for my project.
### **Bitter**
![BitterImage](assets/read-me-images/bitter-picture.png)  
I chose Bitter in line with my other theme – robust yet friendly. The font looks more organic and handwritten, similar to how a bar menu would be written on a chalkboard. It also complements Raleway’s modern feel.
## ImageryandMedia
I obtained my images from a few different sources. Like all the selections so far, be it colours or fonts, I wanted the imagery to play into the themes of the site. The imagery in the project provokes a positive user response in line with the enticing theme of the site, without detracting from the content within the pages. 
All the images have a consistent feel with in-focus and out-of-focus elements. All images of unsuitable size were resized and compressed to ensure a good level of performance. Below you will find a full breakdown of the images used throughout the project.  
### **[Wix Logo Creator](https://bit.ly/3vx0UI5)**   
I used the wix logo creator to create the bar’s logo which is displayed in the nav bar and the beer label images contained in the Our Menu page. The logo has a neon bar sign feel which promotes the purpose of the page.

* #### **[Homepage Background Image](https://bit.ly/3v29Pks)**
The South Stand Brewery & Taproom is an alternative experience in Warrington to your usual pub. The bar taps background image promotes the purpose of the site to the user. The site is for a taproom, so the user sees beer taps and a beer being poured as soon as they visit the site. The amount of taps displayed in the image signals to the user that there is a lot of choice in terms of drinks offerings provided by the business, which is inline with the business’ goals of standing out from the rest of the businesses in the area. The black and white tone of the picture and the out-of-focus elements entice the user to learn more and by doing this, it increases the chances of the user visiting the bar.
* #### **[Our Menu Page Top Image](https://bit.ly/3v1W9pq)**
The image at the top of the Our Menu page plays into the bar signage element in line with the business logo, it is hazy in nature and displays a neon sign, with the word, ‘Craft’. This indicates to the key demographic of the site that this is where you can find craft ale locally. The warm tone of the sign leans into the friendly theme of the site. 
### **[Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/home)**
* #### **[About Page Backround Image](https://shutr.bz/3ynUInf )**
On the About page, I chose an image with more neutrality so it wouldn’t detract from the content. The purpose of the page is for the user to learn about the ethos, attitude, and history of the business so the content is king here. In saying that, the image still signals to themes of the site with an out-of- focus bar displaying many alcoholic beverages indicating to the user that there is a lot of choice, but the out-of-focus nature entices the user to pay a visit to the bar. The friendly theme of the site and venue comes through via the warm vintage lighting displayed in the foreground of the image – indicating an exciting, vibrant atmosphere. 
* #### **[Grab a Table Page Background Image](https://shutr.bz/3woD9lr)**  
The image shows drinks lined up on a table which holds semantic relevance to the purpose of the page which is to book a table at the venue. Again, the image has in-focus and out-of-focus elements to entice the user. The interplay between the positioning and colour of the form container, fonts, and background image create an aesthetically pleasing visual journey for the user.
### **[Canva](https://www.canva.com/)**
I used a Canva template to create the beer label images and added my logo. Once I had the beer labels coloured and holding the correct text content, I cropped the images for use within the beer card divs. Links to the shared documents can be found below:
