# South Stand Brewery & Taproom
## Milestone Project 1
### General Purpose & Introduction
This web application is for a fictitious micro-brewery and taproom based in Warrington. The bar fills a gap in the market in Warrington as there are little to no intimate and bespoke drinking experiences in the town. All the pubs and bars are chain pubs that conform to the usual pub/ bar format with very little online presence.
For the South Stand Brewery & Taproom, I wanted to create an online presence to let users know that there is an alternative more bespoke experience. There are a number of themes that I wanted to reflect in the website:
1.	**Sleek, Simple & Professional** – To rise above the minute online presence of other hospitality venues in the same sector, I wanted to make sure that the design of the website looked professional. I wanted ease of learning and use and aim to keep it very contained so that it can be used with minimal navigation to other pages.
2. **Robust yet friendly** – The brewery and taproom dynamic would usually appeal to a certain type of hip audience. If you look at other companies that offer the similar dynamics such as Founders Brewing or Brewdog, the typography, copy, images and branding are targeted at their key demographic. Whilst it is important to consider the culture of the audience, one of the business goals of the site is to increase awareness and in course footfall to the venue itself. On that basis, I will be using typography, images and colour to give the effect of a rugged no nonsense bar where beer is the passion, but using calls to action and content to promote a friendly atmosphere.
3. **Enticing** – Whilst normal e-commerce or B2B web applications have a focus on providing a lot of information or at least having it available to a user if they wish to see it, to generate interest and foot fall, I will make the site feel enticing and leave users wanting more.

## User Experience
In this section, I am going to explain some of the user experience considerations I made during the development process.
### Strategy
#### Business Goals
Like any hospitality business, the promotion of the ethos is important to engage with a user on an emotional level through the content not just design, structure and layout. The other main goal was to prompt the user to see the business as a positive place where they will enjoy spending time digitally and in person.
The main points I considered during the strategy in terms of the business’ goals were:
- Increase awareness of business and brand.
- Increase footfall in the venue.
- Increase sale of business’ own craft brewed beer against the other offerings provided through the content.
- Generate an enticing exciting environment to leave users wanting to explore the site and visit the venue.
